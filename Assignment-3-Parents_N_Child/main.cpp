    string randomArticlePart = "Lochry's Defeat, also known as the Lochry massacre, was a battle fought on 
    August 24, 1781, near present-day Aurora, Indiana, in the United States. The battle was part of the 
    American Revolutionary War (1775â€“1783), which began as a conflict between Great Britain and the Thirteen 
    Colonies before spreading to the western frontier, where American Indians entered the war as British 
    allies. The battle was short and decisive: about one hundred Indians of local tribes led by Joseph Brant, 
    a Mohawk military leader who was temporarily in the west, ambushed a similar number of Pennsylvania 
    militiamen led by Archibald Lochry. Brant and his men killed or captured all of the Pennsylvanians 
    without suffering any casualties.
    
    Lochry's force was part of an army being raised by George Rogers Clark for a campaign against Detroit, 
    the British regional headquarters. Clark, the preeminent American military leader on the northwestern 
    frontier, worked with Governor Thomas Jefferson of Virginia in planning an expedition to capture Detroit, 
    by which they hoped to bring an end to British support of the Indian war effort. In early August 1781, 
    Clark and about 400 men left Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania by boat, floating down the Ohio River a few days 
    ahead of Lochry and his men, who were trying to catch up.
    
    Joseph Brant's force was part of a combined British and Indian army being raised to counter Clark's 
    offensive. Brant had too few men to challenge Clark, but when he intercepted messengers traveling between 
    Clark and Lochry, he learned about Lochry's smaller group bringing up the rear. When Lochry landed to 
    feed his men and horses, Brant launched his overwhelmingly successful ambush. Because Clark had been 
    able to recruit only a fraction of the men he needed for his campaign, the loss of Lochry's men resulted 
    in the cancellation of Clark's expedition.";
