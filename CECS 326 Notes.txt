Chapter 1

	what is an OS -	a program that acts as an intermediary btwn a user of a computer and the computer 
			hardware
	--->> users 	
	--->> application layer (spreadsheet/browser/etc)* 
	--->> system software layer (command line interpreter / compiler)*
		*Application programes <defines the ways in which the system resources are used to solve
			the computing problems of the users
	--->> Operating System (O.S.) < controls and coordinates use of hardware among various apps & users>
	--->> Hardware <provides basic computing resources>			

	OS goals
		execute user programs and make solving user problems easier 
		make computer system convenient to use
		use the computer hardware in an efficient manner

	OS is a resource manager
		ex: if a CPU is needed, its the OS that ALLOCATES the CPU

	Computer system structure


	Caching
		when found incache, we save time by not having to look in slower device
		data often found in cache tends to be the most frequently used data
		cache hit is fastest
		cache miss means that you need to look in the slower device

Direct Memory Access (DMA) Structure
	key: speeds up computer operations

OS Structure
	Multiprogramming or Batch system:
		time multiplexing - jobs take turns using the cpu
		this strategy would produce a higher throughput (more tasks completed per unit time)
	Timesharing or multitasking
		response time is important
		realize that each environment has its own set of requirement

OS Operations

I/O subsystem
	simplify the computing environment
		also: making the environment more uniform
	buffering- speeds up computing
		transfers data across hardware components which operate at different speed
